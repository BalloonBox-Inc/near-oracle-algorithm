# Python Unit tests :pencil2:

This directory contains all the Python unit tests we built to ensure quality and robustness of our algorithm. We build the tests using the Python library called `unittest` and feeding it with dummy data. To execute them run the following command from the root folder:

```bash
python -m unittest -v tests  # for all validators
```
