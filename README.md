## Credit Scoring on NEAR Protocol ðŸ”® :ringed_planet: :mag:

NearOracle is an oracle for credit scoring that runs on the NEAR protocol and serves web3 users interested in lending or borrowing money in the crypto space. This repo contains the Python codebase of the credit scoring algorithm used by the NearOracle dApp, a dApp that BalloonBox developed through a grant by the [NEAR Foundation](https://near.foundation/). The oracle reads in the user's fiat or crypto financial history and uses it to calculate a numerical score, namely an integer representing a user's financial health. Ranking users through a credit score is essential to distinguish between trusted and suspicious agents in the web3 space. The dApp caters to a specific use case, namely unsecured P2P lending: facilitating lending and borrowing of crypto loans.

###### How does the dApp work?
- it acquires user's financial data by integrating with three validators ([Plaid](https://dashboard.plaid.com/overview), [Coinbase](https://developers.coinbase.com/), and [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/))
- it runs the credit scoring algorithm to compute a score assessing a user's financial health
- it writes the score to the blockchain via a Wasm smart contract build using the Rust `NEAR SDK`

###### In this Repo
This GitHub repo contains the codebase of the NearOracle credit score algorithm. The code features 3 validators, 4 API integrations, 12 score metrics, and 25+ functions to calculate users' credit scores. The front end of the NearOracle DApp (see codebase at [`near-oracle-client`](https://github.com/BalloonBox-Inc/near-oracle-client)), after fetching the user's data, passes it to the algorithm, which executes and returns a score via a Rust smart contract (see codebase at [`near-oracle-contract`](https://github.com/BalloonBox-Inc/near-oracle-contract)).

Continue to read these docs to understand the algorithm or clone this project and spin it up in your local machine.

## Credit Score Model

### Algorithm Architecture

Understand the credit score model at a glance.
There are three distinct models, one for each of our chosen validators, namely Plaid, Coinbase & MetaMask.

**Plaid** model (powered by [Plaid](./images/logic_plaid.png))

- :curling_stone: analyze up to 5 years of transaction history
- :gem: dynamically select user's best credit card products
- :dart: detect recurring deposits and withdrawals (monthly)
- :hammer_and_wrench: deploy linear regression on minimum running balance over the past 24 months
- :magnet: auto-filter & discard microtransactions
- :pushpin: inspect loan, investment, and saving accounts

**Coinbase** model (powered by [Coinbase](./images/logic_coinbase.png))

- :bell: check for user KYC status
- :key: live fetch of top 25 cryptos by market cap via [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) API
- :fire: dynamically select user's best crypto wallets
- :closed_lock_with_key: auto-convert any currency to USD in real-time
- :bulb: analyze all transactions since Coinbase account inception
- :moneybag: compute user's net profit

**MetaMask** model (powered by [Covalent](./images/logic_covalent.png))

- :fox_face: authenticate user via MetaMask
- :parachute: account for credits, debits transactions, transfers, frequency, the cumulative balance now, and more
- :chains: fetch up to 100 top ERC20 tokens (by market capitalization) via [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) API
- :bar_chart: analyze time series of latest 400 transactions on MetaMask wallet
- :lady_beetle: inspect historical OHLCV for last 30 days


### Interpret Your Score

NarOracle returns to the user a numerical score ranging from 300-900 points. The score is partitioned into categorical bins </br> (`very poor` | `poor` | `fair` | `good` | `very good` | `excellent` | `exceptional`), which describe the score qualitatively (see fuel gauge in the diagram below). Every bin is associated with a USD equivalent, which represents the maximum loan amount in USD that a user qualifies for, based on the NearOracle calculation. Lastly, the NearOracle also returns the estimated payback period, namely the expected time it will take for the user to pay back the loan.

The loan terms (loan amount, qualitative descriptor, and payback period) are algorithmic recommendations, and, therefore, they are not prescriptive. Although we strongly advise lenders and borrowers to consider NearOracle's parameters, we also encourage them to stipulate loan terms that best suit their unique needs.

## Clone This Project :key: :lock: :package:

### 1. Clone locally
Download or clone the repo to your machine, running in terminal

  ```bash
  git clone  ... my-project-name
  cd my-project-name
  ```

### 2. Install dependencies
Run either of the commands below. You'll need either `pip` or `conda` package manager

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt                                 # using pip
  conda create --name <env_name> --file requirements.txt          # using Conda
  ```

### 3. Environment variables
Create a `.env` local file in your root folder. The required credentials are

  ```bash
  PLAID_ENV='sandbox'
  DATABASE_URL='postgres_url'
  ```

### 4. Execute locally
If you want to test the algorithm alone in the backend (independently from the dApp frontend) we recommend you do so using the Swagger API platform. Running the commands below will redirect you to the Swagger, where you'll be able to run *in the backend* trial credit score calculations for your preferred validator (Plaid, Coinbase, or Covalent)
  ```bash
  cd my-project-name
  uvicorn main:app â€“reload
  ```

  > :warning: The oracle will execute properly, only if you set up a correct and complete `.env` file. <br/>
  > :radioactive: depending on the validator you choose you'll need to enter the parameters for the API endpoint request.
